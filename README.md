In the first round, the player with $50,000 has more money than the person with $20,000, so the richer player becomes the leader and moves on. This leaves the second round with the player with $20,000 and Jennie, who has moved to the election tile and has $30,000. In this round, Jennie has more money and becomes the leader. As a result, it took two rounds for Jennie to win.
